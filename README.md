# DV_Capture
Capturing DV videos to digital files

To use it, simply save the script wherever you like, make it executable, and if necessary edit the BASE_DIR variable to another path. Then, you call it with the name of your tape as the only argument: ./minidv.sh tape23. The rest should happen by itself. After that, use HandBrake on the videos in ${BASE_DIR}/converted with whichever settings suit your needs.
